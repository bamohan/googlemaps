Udacity Project 5 - Neighborhood Map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was to incorporate the Google Maps API with Knockout JS to create a 
neighborhood map of interesting locations.  Functionality should include clickable list and markers, 
filtering search capability of list and markers, and the use of a third party API (Yelp). Error handling must be 
used in case of failure to load.

1. At least 5 locations important to me
2. Google map with markers showing location of the attractions.
3. Infowindows open with information about the specified location and markers bounce when clicked
4. Integration of Yelp API.  Displays the phone number retrieved from Yelp
5. List of locations animate appropriate marker when clicked
6. List search/filter is functional and filters with markers
7. Error handling is set for Google API and Yelp API.
8. Application is responsive to different device sizes.
