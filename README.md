Udacity Project 5 - Neighborhood Map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was to incorporate the Google Maps API with Knockout JS to create a 
neighborhood map of interesting locations.  

Here are the features of the app:
* Enter search criteria in the text field to filter locations matching the search criteria. This should filter both the markers and the list of locations that match the search criteria
* Click on a marker to get more information about the location. This should display the name and phone number from Yelp
* Clicking an item in the location list selects the corresponding marker
* The active location marker bounces when selected
